Getting-Cleaning-Data
=====================

My work in the Coursera MOOC [Getting &amp; Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata).

Using the provided dataset (link below), I have:

1. Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Applied descriptive names to the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code to accomplish these tasks is contained within the run_analysis.R file.
